## üéØ Project Overview

I set up a personal portfolio website hosted on an Apache web server running on an Ubuntu VM (using VirtualBox). The website is accessible from my host machine via the VM's local IP address.  
This project demonstrates my skills in system administration, web server configuration, and basic networking. üöÄ

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- üêß **Ubuntu** (VirtualBox VM)
- üì¶ **VirtualBox**
- üÖ∞Ô∏è **Apache2**
- üåê **HTML**
- üñ•Ô∏è **Bash**

## üìã What I Did

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepared the Ubuntu VM & Installed Apache

I started by updating and upgrading my Ubuntu VM:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

Then, I installed Apache2 and verified that it was running:

```bash
sudo apt install apache2
sudo systemctl status apache2
```
Apache showed as `active (running)`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Built My Portfolio Website

I navigated to the web root:

```bash
cd /var/www/html
```

Using `nano`, I created a custom `index.html` for my personal portfolio (see [`index.html`](index.html)).  
I set the correct file permissions so Apache could serve my files:

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Accessed the Website Locally

To find my VM‚Äôs IP address, I ran:

```bash
ifconfig
```

I then opened a browser on my host machine and entered the VM‚Äôs IP, successfully accessing the portfolio site.

## üåê Networking Concepts Demonstrated

- The VM and host machine are on the same bridged network.
- By entering the VM‚Äôs IP in my host‚Äôs browser, I demonstrated internal network access and understanding of network interfaces, IP addresses, and local web hosting.
